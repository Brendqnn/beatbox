# Beatbox Visualization

Beatbox Visualization is a simple audio visualization program that visualizes audio data in real-time. It uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to convert audio data into a graphical representation, allowing you to see the amplitude of audio frequencies.

## Features

- Real-time audio visualization.
- Hann window applied to the audio data for better accuracy.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library installed.
3. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler (e.g., GCC).
4. Run the compiled executable.

## Dependencies

- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/): A simple and easy-to-use library for developing 2D and 3D games in C.

## License
